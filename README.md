# Gurobi-Python-Code-Transfer
This is the test thread of using [gurobipy](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/the_gurobi_python_interfac.html) for implementing optimization problems.

## Prerequisite

First you need to have a Gurobi license and add the Gurobi solver in Python. We suggest using an Anaconda version of Intel Python and Gurobi with the latest versions.

## Support Modules

It is supposed to include the following:

* [Linear Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming)
* [Quadratic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming)
* [Mixed-integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
* [Second-order Cone Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cone_programming)
* [Semi-definite Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming)
* [Semi-infintie Programming (Currently Unavailable)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-infinite_programming)
